# Overview

{Provide a description the map software that you wrote. Describe how to use your software.  Describe the source of the data that you used.}
My software is a map of hiking trails in the western-coastal area of California. I chose this location because I have a lot of friends there and hope to hike with them when I visit. Users can interact with the html-embedded software via intuitive mouse-based movements including dragging the map to reloacte, and scrolling to zoom in and out. Users can also click on notable trailheads in the map to display additional data about the trail elevation, length, and where to park to best access the trail. The GIS blanket map is hosted by ArcGIS Online, and the data within the popup layer is provided via the California department of Parks and Recreation, and Esri mapping services.

I wrote this software so that I could get a handle on GIS mapping and understand how to implement it into my programs and projects for the future. I chose to do a trail-tracker because I am starting to get into hiking and really like GeoCaching and think there is room for fun projects in those bounds using GIS mapping.

# Development Environment

I used VScode as a development environment to create this software.

I created the webpage for this project in HMTL and implemented the GIS mapping functionality using javascript.

# Useful Websites

* [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/js/default.asp)
* [ArcGIS Developer](https://developers.arcgis.com/javascript/latest)

# Future Work

* Add functionality to display different types of trails, including trails that allow for mountain biking / have good reviews from mountain bikers
* Create a personalized dataset of trailheads that I have visited, and display additional content including my notes of the experience on that trail
* Add html+js options in the site to log trips I take / hikes i go on, and add them to the database that is called for the map.
