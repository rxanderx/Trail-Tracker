            <h2>Motivation</h2>
            <p>I created this project because I wanted to build something that would have use and impact in my life.<br>
            My family loves hiking, and I am starting to get into it as well- there are a lot of resources to see lists of hikes that people have been on, but I wanted to try making one for myself.<br>
             I chose to use GIS mapping so that I could see relative locations of the hiking trails, and I chose to display information factors via GIS pop-ups that would impact hiking difficulty.</p>
